    <p> One of the first scripts I write in any language is almost always a prime searching algorithm, given my interest in mathematics and specifically, computational number theory.</p>
    <p>While this page is still in progress, I hope to create a repository full of information about generating primes and verifying primality, look for updates soon!</p>
