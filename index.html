          <b><p style="font-family:'Courier New'">What are prime numbers?</p></b>
          <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Any natural number <i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is greater than 1, that has exactly two factors (1 and <i>n</i>, itself) is called a prime number; any number that does not have this property is called a composite number. Intuitively, you may imagine prime numbers to be almost like Lego pieces that can be used to build up large sets analogous to composite numbers. It would, thus, be fair to call prime numbers the building blocks of all natural numbers. The following is an illustration of how a prime number may be factorized versus a composite number. </p>
          <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> The factorization for prime numbers includes only 1 and itself, p: <i>p = p * 1 </i></p>
          <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> The factorization for composite numbers includes its constituent prime numbers: <i>n = x * y * z * 1</i> where all <i>x, y,</i> and <i>z</i> are prime numbers</p>
          <br>
          <b><p style="font-family:'Courier New'">How many prime numbers?</p></b>
          <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Short answer: infinitely many. This may seem counterintuitive at a cursory glance given that the frequency of prime numbers seems to go down as you progress further deeper into natural numbers but their infinitude can be proven rigorously, thanks to Euclid.</p>
          <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Suppose you create a finite set of prime numbers declaring that this list contains all prime numbers, one could disprove you by the following method: </p>
          <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> 
            List of primes: <i>p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, p<sub>3</sub>... p<sub>n</sub></i><br>
            Suppose a number <i>n</i> exists which is defined as <i>m = p<sub>1</sub> * p<sub>2</sub> * p<sub>3</sub>... * p<sub>n</sub></i><br>     
            As it stands, <i>m</i> is divisible by all primes in the list, that is, <i>0 ≡ m (mod p<sub>i</sub>)</i> for all <i>i</i><br>
            Adding 1 to this <i>m</i> however, makes it such that <i>1 ≡ m + 1 (mod p<sub>i</sub>)</i> for all <i>i</i><br>
            This new number, <i>m + 1</i>, isn't divisible by any of the primes that were included in the finite set which implies that <i>m + 1</i> is prime<br>
            This refutes the earlier claim of a finite list with all primes since it did not include m, and thus, there's an infinite number of primes in the grander set of natural numbers<br>
          </p>
