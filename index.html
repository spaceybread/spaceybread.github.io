        <b><p style="font-family:'Courier New'">What's a prime number?</p></b>
        <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Any natural number <i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is greater than 1, that has exactly two factors (1 and <i>n</i>, itself) is called a prime number; any number that does not have this property is called a composite number. Intuitively, you may imagine prime numbers to be almost like Lego pieces that can be used to build up large sets analogous to composite numbers. It would, thus, be fair to call prime numbers the building blocks of all natural numbers. The following is an illustration of how a prime number may be factorized versus a composite number.
