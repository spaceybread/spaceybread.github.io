     <b><h1 class="header">research interests</h1></b>
      <p class="para">My research interests lie broadly in algorithms and complexity. The following is a small subset of the interesting problems I've spent time looking at in the past: 
      
      <b>Graph Theory</b>: In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01781"><i>Faster Detours in Undirected Graphs</i> [/]</a>, the authors state, "it remains open whether $k$-Longest Detour is in $\mathsf{P}$ even for the special case of $k=1$!" My most recent work has explored this problem by considering reductions to bridge-finding. 

      <b>Algorithmic Number Theory</b>: In <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-0348-9078-6_34"><i>The Role of Smooth Numbers in Number Theoretic Algorithms</i> [/]</a>, Carl Pomerance discusses how smooth numbers are central to many algorithms in number theory. In particular, such numbers are generally easier to factor, which suggests a kind of hierarchy of integers with respect to factoring difficulty: numbers with certain structural properties are easier to factor than others. Intriguingly, this hierarchy appears robust under classical assumptions but collapses in the quantum setting, as demonstrated by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9508027">Shor’s algorithm [/]</a>. I’m interested in exploring other “special” classes of numbers to better understand this hierarchy.

      <b>Fuzzy Extactors</b>: In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0602007"><i>Fuzzy Extractors: How to Generate Strong Keys from Biometrics and Other Noisy Data</i> [/]</a>, the authors present a new cryptographic primitive called fuzzy extractors. In my undergraduate thesis, I constructed fuzzy classifiers which are wrappers that use lattice-based fuzzy extractors for authentication systems. More recently, I've been looking into providing theoretical bounds for the loss of entropy when going from distance-based classifiers to lattice-based classifiers.
