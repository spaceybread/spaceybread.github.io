<b><h1 class="header">about me :)</h1></b>
<p class="para">Hi! My name is Ansh Aggarwal and I'm an undergraduate student majoring in mathematics and computer science at UW-Madison. 
      
      I'm interested in theoretical computer science which I hope to pursue at a graduate school starting in Fall 2026. I am currently employed as a programmer at the Space Science and Engineering Center where I work on products that talk to satellites and process their data! In the past [Summer 25], I worked as a quantitative analyst intern at Graviton Research Capital. I am also involved with research in algorithms, complexity, and cryptography under the supervision of <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chatterjee/">Prof. Rahul Chatterjee [/]</a> and <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bach/">Prof. Eric Bach [/]</a>.

      Some of my favorite classes at UW-Madison include: 
      - CS 787: Advanced Algorithms [Fall 24]
      - CS 710: Complexity Theory [Fall 25]
      - CS 704: Principles of Programming Languages [Fall 25]
      - CS 880: Graduate Cryptography [Spring 25]
      - CS 559: Computer Graphics [Spring 25]
      
      Note: Classes with codes > 699 are classified as graduate classes.
