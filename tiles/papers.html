      <div class="abs"><strong>Abstract</strong>: We analyze algorithms for computing the $n$th prime $p_n$ and establish asymptotic bounds for several approaches. Using existing results on the complexity of evaluating the prime-counting function $\pi(x)$, we show that the binary search approach computes $p_n$ in $O(\sqrt{n} \, (\ln n)^4)$ time. Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis and Cram√©r's conjecture, we construct a tighter interval around $\text{li}^{-1}(n)$, leading to an improved sieve-based algorithm running in $O(\sqrt{n} \, (\ln^{7/2} n) \, \ln \ln n)$ time. This improvement, though conditional, suggests that further refinements to prime gap estimates may yield provably faster methods for computing primes.</div>

      <div class="abs"><strong>Abstract</strong>: We define the notion of a fuzzy classifier that uses fuzzy extractors to compute similarity between a given set of registration vectors (and a corresponding center) and a queried data point. We show that this notion naturally corresponds to the notion of a radial classifier which similarly admits a set of registration vectors and a radius to decide whether a queried point belongs in the given class or not. As such, we define a set of algorithms that allow us to construct an optimized fuzzy classifier from an optimized radial classifier and similarly, construct an optimized radial classifier from an optimized fuzzy classifier. This in turn, simplifies the problem of optimizing a fuzzy classifier to optimizing a radial classifier which is considered to be easier. As such, we provide algorithms that optimize a radial classifier over a large dataset to take it from a good classifier for a single class to a good classifier that works across a variety of classes. Altogether, we construct an optimized fuzzy classifier on the basis of a single-class radial classifier.</div></p>
