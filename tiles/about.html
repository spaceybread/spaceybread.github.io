<b><h1 class="header">about me :)</h1></b>
<p class="para">Hi! My name is Ansh Aggarwal and I'm an undergraduate student majoring in mathematics and computer science at UW-Madison. 
      
      I'm interested in theoretical computer science which I hope to pursue at a graduate school starting in Fall 2026. I am currently employed as a programmer at the Space Science and Engineering Center where I work on products that talk to satellites and process their data! I am also involved with research in algorithms, complexity, and cryptography.
