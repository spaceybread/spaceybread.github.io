      <p class="para">I enjoy programming and I have been doing it for a long time, here are some of the projects I have worked on: 
      
      <b><a href="https://github.com/mcidasv/mcidasv">McIDAS-V [/]</a></b>: McIDAS-V is a free, open source, visualization and data analysis software package.
      
      <b><a href="https://github.com/spaceybread/refactored-spork">Busy Beavers [/]</a></b>: I wrote busy beaver simulations to explore computability. 

      <b><a href="https://github.com/spaceybread/solid-funicular">Three-Body Problem [/]</a></b>: I wrote a three body simulation after reading Liu Cixin's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem">novel [/]</a>

      <b><a href="https://github.com/spaceybread/fluffy-system">Conway's Game of Life [/]</a></b>: Cellular automata are fun; also check out <a href="https://github.com/spaceybread/stunning-tribble">Langton's Ant [/]</a>

      <b><a href="https://github.com/spaceybread/sturdy-octo-guide">Sudoku Solver [/]</a></b>: Uses graph coloring to solve basic 9x9 sudoku puzzles.

      <b>Calculating Pi</b>: This is a fun one, I love trying new ways to compute Pi with progressively better precision, some of them are <a href="https://github.com/spaceybread/pi-am-doing-this">Chudnovsky algorithm [/]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spaceybread/pi-stress-test">Madhava-Leibniz series [/]</a>, and a good old <a href="https://github.com/spaceybread/congenial-spoon">Monte Carlo computation [/]</a>

      This list is not complete and you can find some of my other projects on my <a href="https://github.com/spaceybread?tab=repositories">Github page [/]</a>
