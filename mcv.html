          <img id="imgVIIRS" src="media/mcv/VIIRS.jpg" alt="VIIRS Imagery">
          <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">McIDAS, short for "Man computer Interactive Data Access System," is a meteorological data delivery, visualization, and analysis software package developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC). McIDAS-V is the free and open-source version of McIDAS written mostly in Java. Links for more information:</p>

          </ul>
          <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">I have been helping develop McIDAS-V and this page is a collection of interesting features, bugs, and enhancements that I have worked on in particular. Almost all of the following are associated with a number which corresponds to an inquiry in the internal inquiry database at the SSEC.</p>

          <b><p style="font-family:'Courier New'">[<a href="https://mcidas.ssec.wisc.edu/inquiry-v/?inquiry=1935">1935</a>] Max over time steps and Float.NaN</p></b> 
              <img id="img1935b" src="media/mcv/KBOX-MAX-New-Color.png">
              <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Min/Max are some of the most fundamental operations in programming languages which, simply, takes two or more elements and finds the minimum/maximum of the given set. Java, unsurprisingly, has its own version for both: Math.min and Math.max. For the most part, they behave as you'd expect them to however, interestingly, if they are given NaN as a value to compare, the functions <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#max(float,%20float)"> <i>always</i> return NaN.</a></p>
              <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Some datasets include null values to represent missing data and as such should be ignored but due to how Math.max and Math.min operate, they would override genuine data and leave blank spots in displays. To get around this, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/mcidasv/mcidasv/blob/b884514f9371d26415577650eae7ee2694006030/ucar/unidata/data/grid/GridMath.java#L3103">missingMax and missingMin</a> that set NaN to Float.MIN_VALUE and Float.MAX_VALUE respectively which allows non-missing data to be take precedent over missing data.</p>
              <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> The most obvious difference was that L2 radar displays (like here, in the image to the left) looked a lot more populated than they did before. </p>

          <b><p style="font-family:'Courier New'">[<a href="https://mcidas.ssec.wisc.edu/inquiry-v/?inquiry=2803">2803</a>] Organizing viewpoints</p></b> 
              <img id="imgViewpoint" src="media/mcv/viewpoints.png">
              <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> A 'viewpoint' in McIDAS refers to a point used to look at a specific section of the world map. For example, if you wanted to look at the a region around Madison, you'd probably look at a latitude range between 42째 and 44째 north and longitude range between 88째 and 90째. While the software package offers a pretty big selection of predefined viewpoints, it also allows users create custom viewpoints (I also helped with this! [<a href="https://mcidas.ssec.wisc.edu/inquiry-v/?inquiry=3151">3151</a>]) and save them for future use. </p>
              <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Originally, these custom viewpoints appeared in a list in the order this was created, which, for a variety of reasons, was less than ideal. The ticket asked for these viewpoints to be sorted alphabetically but it included a suggestion: to create 'folders' for viewpoints. As such, I created a <a href="https://github.com/mcidasv/mcidasv/blob/b884514f9371d26415577650eae7ee2694006030/edu/wisc/ssec/mcidasv/ui/UIManager.java#L3314">system</a> that would take any viewpoint named in the format "folderName>vpName" and at it to that folder if it exists and creating it first if it didn't.</p>
